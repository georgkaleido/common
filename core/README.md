## üê≥ Docker

In addition to the Python package, this repository also contains a [Docker image](Dockerfile) for `removebg-core`.

For each [release](https://github.com/remove-bg/kaleido-core-removebg/releases), several images are being built
and pushed to the Docker registry.

Configure which Docker images should be built in [`docker-build.yml`](docker-build.yml).

The resulting images will be tagged `[version]-pt[pytorch-version]-cc[compute-compatibility]`.

You can find the list of built images in the release description.

## üöÄ Installation

To use this package, add it to your `requirements.txt`. It depends on the

Then pass [your GemFury token](https://gemfury.com/help/tokens/) to the `pip install` command like so (or

FURY_AUTH_TOKEN=<your token> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Modify [the versions](https://github.com/remove-bg/kaleido-core-removebg/blob/master/Dockerfile#L29-L38) of the packages

  sure to stick to [SemVer](https://semver.org) tag names (e.g. `1.0.0`, no prefix).
